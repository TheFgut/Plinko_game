# Plinko game (Unity)

Plinko is a classic arcade-style game where a ball is dropped from the top of a peg pyramid and bounces randomly as it falls down. The ball eventually lands in one of the slots at the bottom — the closer to the edge, the bigger the (virtual) reward!

The game uses virtual money — rewards are given based on where the ball lands.
